# Variable-Length-Subnet-Masks
Designed and implemented a subnetted network using Cisco Packet Tracer by dividing a /24 into multiple LANs and a point-to-point link. Configured IP addressing, assigned gateways, and implemented static routing to enable full connectivity between networks.

## Platforms Leveraged
- Cisco Packet Tracer

##  Scenario

My job is to subnet the 192.168.5.0/24 network to provide sufficient addressing for all four LANs as well as the point-to-point connection between R1 and R2. I will assign the first usable address to the PC in each LAn, then assign the last usable address to the router's interface in each LAN. After that, I will configure the static routes on each router so that all PCs can ping eachother.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space. Then assign the second-largest subnet after it. Repeat the process until all subnets have been assigned.

In the lab, the largest subnet is LAN 2 with 64 hosts so this is the first subnet chosen. I borrowed seven bits so all 64 hosts can fit in the subnet. The borrowed hosts came out to 126 hosts, making LAN 2 a /25 subnet. The network address of LAN 2 is 192.168.5.0/25 when you turn all the borrowed bits into zeros. The first usable address is 192.168.5.1/25. The broadcast address is 192.168.5.127/25 because I turned all the borrowed bits into ones. Making the last usable address 192.168.5.126/25.

I repeated the process for the other three LANs including the point-to-point connection. I did the subnetting process in the screenshot below.

### 2. Assign the first usable address to the PC in each LAN

I went into the "Config" settings for each PC. I added the first usable address to the PC, then I added the last usuable address to the default gateway, aka the router. I repeated the steps for LAN 1, 3, and 4.

### 3. Assign the last usable address to the router's interface in each LAN

I went into the router's CLI. I went into each interface, turned on the port with the command "no shutdown." I added the last usable address to the respected interface, and repeated the process for the other LANs, as well as the point-to-point connection.

### 4. Configure static routes on each router so that all PCs can ping each other.

I went into each router's CLI once more and I confired the static routes so that I have a route to each LAN on the other router.

### 5. Test the connection by sending pings from one PC to the next

I tested the connection to see if the PCs can oing each other. Sure enough, they did.
